# netcdf

**WIP**

Crystal bindings to libnetcd v 4.

Right now this just contains the c bindings.  I hope to write some short helper methods similar to python netcdf4 - [link](http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/)

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  netcdf:
    github: fridgerator/netcdf
```

## Usage

require "netcdf"
```
